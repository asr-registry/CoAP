### Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) IoT Protocol Library

CoAP is an IoT protocol. CoAP stands for Constrained Application Protocol, and it is defined in RFC 7252. CoAP is a simple protocol with low overhead specifically designed for constrained devices (such as microcontrollers) and constrained networks. This protocol is used in M2M data exchange and is very similar to HTTP, even if there are important differences that we will cover laters.

The main features of CoAP protocols are:

- Web protocol used in M2M with constrained requirements
- Asynchronous message exchange
- Low overhead and very simple to parse
- URI and content-type support
- Proxy and caching capabilities
